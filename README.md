## Project Overview
    The Personalized Medication and Lifestyle Companion is a Python and Flutter-based project designed to provide tailored healthcare recommendations. The project leverages deep learning techniques to analyze         patient data and offer personalized medication plans and lifestyle changes. The companion app ensures users receive the right medication at the right time, along with suggestions to improve overall well-being.

## Features
    Personalized Medication Plans: Generate medication schedules based on individual health data.
    Lifestyle Recommendations: Provide daily suggestions to enhance physical and mental well-being.
    Real-Time Notifications: Remind users of upcoming medication and suggest activities.
    Data Analysis: Utilize deep learning to analyze patient data and improve recommendation accuracy.
    Cross-Platform: Accessible via web using Flutter.
## Tech Stack
## Backend
    Python: Core programming language used for data processing and deep learning models.
    TensorFlow/PyTorch: For developing and training deep learning models.
    Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
    Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and utilities.
## Frontend
    Flutter: Framework used for developing the web application.
    Dart: Programming language for the Flutter framework.
    REST API: For communication between the Python backend and Flutter frontend.
## Installation
## Backend (Python)
    Clone the repository:
    bash
    Copy code
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medication-lifestyle-companion.git
    cd medication-lifestyle-companion
    Create a virtual environment:
    bash

    bash
    Copy code
    flutter pub get
    Usage
    Running the Backend
## Navigate to the backend directory:
    bash
    Copy code
    cd backend
## Start the Flask/Django server:
    bash
    Copy code
    python app.py   # or flask run, depending on your setup
    Running the Flutter Web App
    Ensure the backend server is running.
## Navigate to the frontend directory:
    bash
    Copy code
    cd frontend
## Start the Flutter web application:
    bash
    Copy code
    flutter run -d chrome
    Model Training
    If you wish to retrain the deep learning models:

    Prepare your dataset and place it in the data/ directory.
## Run the training script:
    bash
    Copy code
    python train.py
    The trained model will be saved in the models/ directory.
## Flutter Web Application
    The web application, built using Flutter, provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the personalized medication and lifestyle companion. Users can view their medication schedules, receive         recommendations, and track their progress over time.
